# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions for this repo

Overview
- This is a Unity 2022.3 LTS game project (see [ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt](ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt#L1)).
- Code lives under `Assets/` (scripts: `Assets/Scripts/` and individual script files like [Assets/NewBehaviourScript.cs](Assets/NewBehaviourScript.cs#L1-L40)).

Big picture
- Runtime: Unity game built from scenes in `Assets/Scenes/` (editor-managed). Game code is compiled into Unity assemblies; do not hand-edit generated project files like `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` (it's generated by Unity) — see [Assembly-CSharp.csproj](Assembly-CSharp.csproj#L1-L40) for generator metadata.
- Dependencies: controlled by `Packages/manifest.json` (TextMeshPro, Visual Scripting, builtin Unity modules). Refer to that file when adding package-level dependencies.

Developer workflows (what to do and how)
- Edit C# scripts in `Assets/` and open the project with Unity Editor 2022.3.59f1. Changes to scripts are applied by Unity's compilation flow; allow Unity to regenerate project files.
- Typical quick actions:
  - Open in Unity Editor for scene/play testing.
  - Use an IDE with Unity support (VS/VSCode + Unity Debugger).
  - Ignore `Library/`, `Temp/`, and other Unity-generated folders when reasoning about source.
- Command-line builds (example pattern — adapt to your Unity install):
  - Windows (example):
    - `"C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Unity.exe" -quit -batchmode -projectPath "C:/path/to/repo" -buildWindowsPlayer "C:/builds/game.exe"`
  - Prefer using the Unity Editor UI for iterative work; CI should install the same Unity 2022.3.x runtime.

Project-specific conventions & patterns
- Scripts are MonoBehaviour-focused (Start/Update lifecycle). Example: [Assets/NewBehaviourScript.cs](Assets/NewBehaviourScript.cs#L1-L40).
- Do not modify generated MSBuild/csproj targets. Instead, change code under `Assets/` or `Packages/manifest.json`.
- Scene and asset changes are recorded by Unity via `.meta` files: keep `.meta` files in VCS.

Integration points & external dependencies
- Unity packages: check `Packages/manifest.json` for required packages (TextMeshPro, Visual Scripting, etc.).
- Native/editor integrations: Assembly references in `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` point to Unity install location — CI/dev machines must have Unity Editor installed.

What to avoid / gotchas (discovered patterns)
- Library/ and Temp/ are large generated folders and are not part of source — avoid reading them for architecture. Use `ProjectSettings/` and `Assets/` instead.
- The csproj is generated by Unity; changing it directly will be overwritten.

Next steps
- I added this file with concrete links to key files. Tell me if you'd like more examples (e.g., common script patterns, scene naming, or CI build steps) and I will iterate.
